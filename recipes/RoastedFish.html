    <ul>

        <li>Salt and Peppe</li>
    </ul>
    <p><Strong>Steps</Strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse and pat the fish dry.</strong> I recommend giving the fish one more good rinse when you get it
            home. Then
            lightly pat it dry with a paper towel, and transfer it to a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Score the fish.</strong> If the fish counter did not already do this for you, use a knife to cut
            slits about an inch
            apart across the top of the fish. They do not need to be super-deep — just enough to cut through the skin.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brush the fish thoroughly with oil, inside and out. Using an oil with a high smoke point, generously
                brush
                the outside</strong> of the fish with oil on both sides, being sure to also get the oil inside the slits
            you just
            cut. Then briefly brush some oil on the inner cavity of the fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuff the cavity with your aromatics.</strong> In this recipe, I recommend fresh herbs, lemon slices
            and garlic. But
            please experiment with whatever seasonings you love! Also, one note on the garlic — be sure to stuff it all
            the way into the cavity of the fish, or it may burn if it is left exposed.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the heck outta the fish.</strong> I recommend adding lots of sea salt, freshly-cracked black
            pepper, and
            garlic powder to the outside of the fish. Plus a bit on the inside cavity as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then that’s it! Your fresh fish is officially ready to go</p>
